fluxions /flʌksij+on+z/ [flʌk.si.jɒnz] are inspired by isaac newton 's concept of 
"fluxions" /flʌks+jən+z/ [flʌk.ʃ(ə)nz]
they are the elements of a totally ordered infinite dimentional vector space over the reals,
written with powers of the constant ε (and ω) differentiating its components,
where ε is a number such that 
x∈ℝ, y∈ℝ, 0 ≠ x, 0 ≠ y ⇒ yεˣ ∉ ℝ
x∈ℝ, y∈ℝ, 0 < x, 0 < y ⇒ 0 < xε < y

ω is defined as such:
ω = ε⁻¹

the function 'lim' can be defined as:
z∈ℝ<ε> ⇒ lim(z)∈ℝ<+∞,-∞>
z∈ℝ<ε>, x∈ℝ, y∈ℝ, x < z < y ⇒ x < lim(z) < y 

a similar function 'ℜ' can be defined as simply taking the real part of a fluxion:
ℜ(7ω²+3+2ε) = 3
but
lim(7ω²+3+2ε) = ∞
ℜ is the same as lim a lot of the time.

the characteristic function C of a fluxion z is the function such that C(ω) = z
p(z) = C ⇒ C(ω) = z
(
    I don't think "characteristic function" is a good name for this,
    I have only really defined this as a concept because it is useful in the definition of rank.
    I also feel this definition is probably not sufficient,
    what I really mean is "take all the ωs in a fluxion and replace them with xs"
)

the rank of a fluxion is the largest power of ω that occurs in it and is defined as such:
rank(z) = log_ω((O⁻¹∘p(z))(ω)) = ln((O⁻¹∘p(z))(ω))/ln(ω)
(
    I think this definition needs explaining:
    in big O notation you can say that certain programs "are" O(x) or O(log(x)) etc.
    I have chosen to interpret this as the function of their time complexity *equaling* O(x) or O(log(x)) etc.
    O is a bijection but not a function (just like \x -> ±x).
    O⁻¹ however is a function but is not an injection or surjection (just like \x -> |x|).
)

a fluxion can be "normalised" as such:
norm(z) = z/(ω^rank(z))

ℜ(norm(7ω²+3+2ε)) = 7
ℜ(norm(2+7ε+5ε²)) = 2
ℜ(norm(2ε³+5ε²)) = 5

ℜ(x) = lim(x) iff ℜ(x) = ℜ(norm(x)) 

x∈ℝ, f(x)∈ℝ ⇒ f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) = n!ℜ(f(x+ε)/(ε^n))

fluxions are useful when working with zero as ε is pretty much zero but one can divide by it
you can replace awkward zeros with εs and take lim when you are done and you'll probably be right
(
    for any continuous function f from reals to reals, I conjecture that when f(0) is defined, f(0) = lim(f(ε))
    this is trivially true if f is the identity function but I don't know if there are counter examples
    ( f is continuous ⇒ lim∘((T^ε)f) = f )
    if this is not true then the statement
    f∈K ⟺ (lim∘((T^ε)f) = f)
    is true where K is the largest set of functions where it is true, 
    functions in K would be nicely behaved in many ways.
)

π = lim(((-1)^ε-1)/iε)
e = lim((1+ε)^ω)
ln(x) = lim(x^ε/ε - ω) = lim((x^ε-1)/ε)
(
    this expression for ln(x) does, as expected, differentiate to approximately 1/x:
    d(x^ε/ε - ω)/dx = x^(ε-1) ≈ x^(-1) = 1/x
    since ln(x) and e^x are inverse functions,
    e^x = lim((1+xε)^ω)
    and so
    e = e^1 = lim((1+ε)^ω)
)

a function f from reals to reals is continuous at a point x iff lim(f(x) - f(x+ε)) = 0 and lim(f(x) - f(x-ε)) = 0
(
    I think?
    you could create a function that is continuous around every real within an infinitessimal range, 
    but still discontinuous everywhere in the reals,
    but plz don't ok,,,
)

ℜ, lim, and norm are all idempotent.

fake haskell code:
(/') :: (ℝ -> ℝ) -> (ℝ -> ℝ) -> (ℝ -> ℝ)
(f /' g) x = (f x) / (g x)

d :: (ℝ -> ℝ) -> (ℝ -> ℝ<ε>)
d f x = f (x+ε) - f x

∇ :: (ℝ -> ℝ) -> (ℝ -> ℝ)
∇ f = lim . (d f) /' (d (\x -> x))

> ∇ (\x -> x²)
lim . (d (\x -> x²) /' d (\x -> x))
lim . (\x -> (x+ε)² - x²) /' (\x -> (x+ε) - x)
lim . \x -> ((x+ε)² - x²) / ((x+ε) - x)
lim . \x -> (x² + 2xε + ε² - x²) / ε
lim . \x -> (2xε + ε²) / ε
lim . \x -> 2x + ε
\x -> lim (2x + ε)
\x -> 2x
